Assignment Week 2

The Lyc√©e d'Excellence de Dakar is today the best high school in Senegal for its quality of education and its results. We wish to innovate and continue to remain the leader by optimizing the entire educational process of the students and offering visibility to parents and the administration.



Mr. Demba Sarr, the director of the school, has called upon a software developer to set up a management application for him. He would like to have the possibility to add classes in the system. For example: Terminal S1, Terminal S2, Terminal L1a, Terminal L2b. He can also modify or delete any information concerning the classes.



To facilitate enrollment in his school, he would also like to have a part in the application where he can add students and put them in a specific class. For example. He can register his daughter Penda Sarr in Terminal s2.



Finally, for a first version of this platform he will need a part where he can list all the students and classes existing in his school.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
